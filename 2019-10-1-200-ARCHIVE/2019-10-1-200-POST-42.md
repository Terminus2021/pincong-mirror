写的真好！大家如果只细看，中英文的文案是不同的，果然中文写给中国人看，英文写给西方世界看。这才是中西合璧自由空气下生出的人才！这才是没有被洗脑心中有真理的勇者！这才是自由香港未来的主人！

不知道这次西方国家是否会吸取二战的经验？

The Hong Kong Protestors’ Letter to the Free World

Fight Against Tyranny, Rise For Liberty

For the past seventy years, we, the Hongkongers have been the closest witness to the innumerable crimes committed by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Back against the wall, we stand today directly against it. We believe it is our duty to call out to the world with the following message: face the threats of the CCP, or face a global-scale humanitarian crisis.

The seventy-year rule of the CCP over the nation of China is built on the blood of its own people. The regime consolidated its own power by mobilizing the people in a gigantic purge of dissidents that became known as the Cultural Revolution. It did the same by turning its military forces against progressively minded civilians, students and intellectuals in the Tiananmen Massacre. It continues to do so today by openly prosecuting human rights activists and lawyers with a legal system designed exclusively to serve the regime instead of the people. In China, the technologies that appear to benefit the people’s lives monitor and control these lives at the same time. The people’s devotion to their land and culture is surreptitiously turned into the devotion to this regime through an all-pervasive propaganda machine. The nationwide union of its diverse peoples over which it prides itself today masks the colonization and genocide of minority groups in Xinjiang and elsewhere. The CCP does not merely resemble a fascist regime - it is a fascist regime.

Among the many totalitarian regimes relying on nationalist propaganda throughout history, the CCP achieved unprecedented success by monopolizing the very concept of ‘China’. In so doing, it blackmails the Chinese people over the entire world into supporting its world-conquest and, when necessary, into becoming soldiers in a politico-economic war with other countries. 

As the last fortress of freedom on Chinese territory, Hong Kong refuses to submit to a corrupt totalitarian regime which distorts its own history and which both silences its people and relies on the ugly nationalist sentiments that it plants among them. At this moment, the CCP is mobilizing all its forces to tear apart the unprotected line of defense which Hong Kong forms for the free world. When ‘the new West Berlin’ falls, it will arrive at the entrance to the heartland of the free world, an entrance into which it waited seventy years to break. 

The rise of China under the rule of the CCP brings the world today close to a point of history, in the last century, where totalitarian regimes were steadily on their way to committing crimes against humanity. As fellow human beings, we have paid a heavy price for letting them become what they have become. Are we willing to learn from our own catastrophic past? Are we willing to turn a blind eye to the CCP’s oppression and massacre of its own people and to its growing dominion over global economy? Are we capable of sincerely believing that a totalitarian regime will, over the course of economic development, come to embrace the values of human rights, democracy and freedom to which we, members of the free world, hold dearly? As the CCP advances unrelentingly and as its economic hegemony feeds at this very second on the economies of other countries through its monstrous ‘Belt and Road Initiative’, we stand at the crossroad of history: can we stop evil before it becomes too powerful to fight off, or is a total war once again inevitable?

We Hongkongers believe in freedom and democracy, in universal values which traverse all races and groups of interest, and in the glorious light of human goodness. Here, we call for the free world to join us and stand as one against the greatest threat it has ever seen. History shall demand no less from a world which wishes to be free.

我觉得应该多列一点中共的罪行，就文革和64，太少了。

明白共匪罪状罊竹难书，但主要是为了感召西方世界，而他们根本什麽都不知道，所以才不详细一一列出。但希望此书能作为第一步，以后我们会再加强论述！

香港人也明白这不是一场单靠香港人自己能赢的抗争，我们要团结才能成事！
